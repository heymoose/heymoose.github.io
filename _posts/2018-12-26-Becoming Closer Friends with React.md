As a developer I have plenty of knowledge working with Javascript and plain HTML and CSS.  I would also sometimes use tools such as Kendo UI to help with creating an application that
feels nice.  That was the convention at my last job and so those were the tools that I
used.

The problem is that is not how most web development is done these days.  In order to do
real web development you've got to know one of the Javascript frameworks out there.  
Enter React.  I've known about React and the basics of how it works for a while now through exposure
to other projects, but I thought it was about time to change that.  If I want to take my
existing web development skills to the next level, I need to know more.

To accomplish that I've been following along through a [React tutorial on Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).  The thinking is that this will fill in any knowledge gaps that I have on the basics by going through the stuff I already know, as well as get me up to date on any modern techniques with newer versions that I was unaware of.  Then after that I'll dive in to the advanced topics and get a feel for how a React project would actually be built in the real world by using tools such as Redux.

My goals for the near future are as follows:

1. Refresh myself on the basics in order to fill in knowledge gaps and get up to date on modern techniques.
2. Create my own simple test application using what I learned.
3. Continue through the course and learn advanced React techniques.
4. Revisit my test application and update it to implement the advanced techniques that I learned.

Step one is actually almost complete, as most of the basics were just a refresher for me.  I'll have another update on what I do for the test application soon, but the plan for now is to take the functionality of my Intrinsify python command line tool and translate it to a web application.  The functionality of the application isn't as important to me as the fact that I use React to build it, but doing this has an additional benefit.  Not only is a simple web application more useful to a larger number of people (how many people actually use command lines tools outside of coders?), but it will make it easier for me to demo it since it will be useable on the internet.
