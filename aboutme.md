My name is Marc Novak.  I grew up and lived in Chicago until 2018, when I moved to
Longmont in Colorado.  I've been programming in one way shape or form since I was about 15.

# Experience
#### Sonoma Partners
At Sonoma Partners (acquired by [EY](https://www.ey.com) in March 2018) I was a
consultant that worked on custom [Microsoft Dynamics CRM](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/) implementations for various clients around the world.

I would customize the backend functionality by writing what is referred to as plugins in C#/.NET.  A
plugin is a piece of C# code that is triggered during certain events that are registered in the system.  I would write C# to handle everything from migrating data from one entity to another after save, to implementing
virtual entities where the data is hidden behind an external API and not stored in the Dynamics database.

Another large part of my job was writing Javascript in tandem with HTML/CSS to make front end changes
to the pages displayed inside the Dynamics system.  I did everything from changing the way a date
field is formatted, to displaying custom fields, to writing custom controls and web applications
in tandem with Kendo UI.

I was also responsible for handling code deploys to whichever environments necessary, including
production, as well as taking on tech lead and mentorship roles to new hires.

#### NEXT/NOW Agency
At [NEXT/NOW](https://nextnowagency.com/) I helped create unique interactive experiences for
branding and marketing purposes, using technology like the Occulus Rift, Microsoft Kinect,
the Intel Leap.

Using the [Unity3d](https://unity3d.com/) game engine I would create what are essentially short
video games.  Among others, I created a racing game where the user controls the car with their body, a suite of
sports games where the player would pretend to swing a baseball bat, shoot a basketball, or practice their
slap shot as famous Chicago athletes, as well as a virtual experience glider racing game where
the player flies through a city scape and acquires power ups by looking at them with an Occulus Rift
head set.

I also worked with the [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), an open source creating
coding toolkit written in C++, to create cool visualizations, often using custom particle
effects or fluid dynamics to create cool graphics that could be played with interactively using
a Microsoft Kinect sensor.

#### AVI-SPL
I was one of a couple students chosen for an internship program at DeVry, and I was placed at AVI-SPL,
which is a company that does audio visual programming and installations.

After a year working as an intern, I graduated school and was hired on for a full time position.

# Other Stuff
I'm into fitness.  I'm a runner, hiker, and I also lift weights.  I love fermenting stuff.  I've made my
own beer, kombucha, sauerkraut, and hot sauce.  I love the fantasy and sci fi genres, no
matter if I'm reading, watching a movie, or playing a video game.  I'm also into finance and
investing.  In fact I wrote a [Python module](https://github.com/heymoose/intrinsify) to help
me in that endeavor.
