Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  I've been meaning to get a personal website
going for a while now, which could serve as a central space to talk about the projects
that I'm working on at the moment, or just whatever I have on my mind.  But I've always
been more interested in working on something else, and so I procrastinated on it.

For the longest time, I was convinced that I should build this website using one of the
big web development frameworks out there in order to showcase my skills (for me this would
have been [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), as that is what I have been learning recently).  I'm
not sure why, but it didn't make sense to me to create a website unless the website
itself was worth showing off.

I started to do just that.  I put my newfound Django skills to use and started to build my
own website.  I knew that it was overkill for what the site would be, and I had
read about the disadvantages to building a simple website in this way, but I went ahead
anyway.  I guess sometimes in order to realize the wisdom of something, you just have
to make the mistake yourself in order to learn from it.

Django was not meant for a website like this.  It's meant for fully fledged, complex sites with
backends, user management, security, and dynamically generated content.  It's meant for
applications that need to be massively scalable.  It's meant for creating a RESTful API
and combining it with a front end framework like React.  If you don't need all of that stuff,
then you're like the guy who owns a massive off-road truck and uses it to commute down the road.
It's inefficient, too big, and you're never going to take advantage of the features
that make it useful.

And so I never really finished my site made with Django.  It was a good learning experience,
but ultimately I was never going to be able to put in the time that would have been necessary
to build and maintain it.  I let the idea fall by the wayside for a bit.  I worked on other
projects and learned new things.  And all the while I wished I had some place to talk
about the things I was learning.  Not only because writing about a thing helps me retain
the information, but because it's useful to have for future employment opportunities.

It was about this time that I learned about Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
is a site generator that creates static sites using mostly just Markdown, Liquid, HTML, and CSS.  No
database necessary, very easy to get started with, and very easy to maintain.  Great for simple,
static websites like this.  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a service that hosts
websites directly from a GitHub repository.  As soon as new content is pushed to the repo,
then the website is updated to reflect those changes.  The two were made to work together,
and if you're a developer who already has a GitHub account anyway, it's by far the easiest
way to get a simple personal website up off the ground.  In fact, for me it was as easy as
forking a jekyll template, changing the \_config.yml file to reflect my personal information,
and start writing posts.  I fiddled with some other things to suit my tastes, but those were
the only necessary steps.  The template I ended up using was [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) by Dean Attali, which fit what I was looking for best.
