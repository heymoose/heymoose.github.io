[In my last post]({% post_url 2018-12-26-Becoming Closer Friends with React %}) I talked about my next steps in terms of gaining more advanced React knowledge.  Things have been a little slow the last week because of the holidays, but I'm back and ready to go.

I'm now done with step 2 of that process, which was to create my own simple React application in order to solidify the basics refresher that I've been doing the last few weeks.  Enter [Intrinsify-React](https://intrinsify-63630.firebaseapp.com/).

[Intrinsify-React](https://intrinsify-63630.firebaseapp.com/) is simply a port of the command line tool that I created using Python a couple of months ago.  The idea was that if I ever want to use that functionality in the real world (much less expect other people to use it), then it cannot just be a command line tool.  What I needed it to be is an actual application with a UI.

It's a really simple one page application, but at this point it already does everything that the command line tool can do.  Enter a list of comma separated tickers and it will spit out a table containing the stock info for each, along with the calculated intrinsic values.  It's lacking some polish and some fancy styling - for instance I think there should be some instructions on the page, and maybe an explanation of what the results mean, and some custom table styling - but that's not really what I'm focussing on at this point.  I can come back to that later after I'm finished focussing on the essentials of React.

It was a good exercise to get the basics down in my head, as well as flex my creative muscles a bit, but I'm really looking forward to applying some of the advanced techniques to the project, as well as add on some of the bells and whistles that I have in mind.

I've hosted the project as it stands now on Firebase [here](https://intrinsify-63630.firebaseapp.com/).  Please feel free to check it out.
